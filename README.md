# ❓ JavaScript Quiz App

## 🧠 About This Project

I built this JavaScript Quiz App to strengthen my understanding of DOM manipulation, conditional logic and state management in JavaScript.

Instead of just creating static components, I wanted to build something interactive — an application where user choices directly affect what happens next. This project helped me think more logically about how applications track progress and manage user input step by step.

It may look simple on the surface, but building it required careful thinking about structure and flow.



## 🎯 Project Goals

When I started this project, my main goals were:

- Improve my understanding of JavaScript arrays and objects
- Practice dynamic DOM updates
- Learn how to manage application state
- Implement score tracking logic
- Improve user experience with feedback and flow control

I wanted to build something that feels smooth and intentional — not just functional.



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structured the quiz layout
- **CSS3** – Styled the interface and ensured responsiveness
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Implemented quiz logic and scoring system

This project is fully frontend-based and runs entirely in the browser.



## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Questions are stored in an array of objects.
2. When the quiz starts, the first question renders dynamically.
3. When a user selects an answer:
   - The app checks if it’s correct.
   - The score updates accordingly.
4. The next question loads automatically.
5. After the final question, the total score is displayed.

Everything updates dynamically without refreshing the page.



## 💡 What I Learned

### Managing Application State

I learned how important it is to track the current question index and score properly. A small logic mistake can break the entire flow.

### Conditional Logic

This project strengthened my understanding of `if` statements and comparisons.

### User Experience

I realized that small details — like feedback messages and smooth transitions — significantly improve how a project feels.



## 😅 Challenges I Faced

- Making sure users cannot select multiple answers for the same question
- Preventing the quiz from breaking when clicking too fast
- Resetting the quiz state properly when restarting

These challenges improved my debugging and logical thinking skills.



## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add a timer for each question
- Add category selection
- Store high scores in local storage
- Add animations between questions



## 🏆 Why This Project Matters to Me

This project helped me move from writing simple scripts to building structured, interactive applications.

It improved my logical thinking and gave me confidence handling user-driven interactions.
