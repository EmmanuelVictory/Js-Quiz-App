# JavaScript Quiz Application 🧠✨

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a simple and interactive **JavaScript Quiz Application** built as part of my learning journey into **Web2 development**.  
The quiz allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, submit their responses, and view their final score on a separate results page.

This project helped me practice **HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic**, especially handling user interactions and dynamic behavior.
